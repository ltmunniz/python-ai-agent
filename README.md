Boot.dev — Build an AI Agent in Python Course

This repository contains my implementations and exercises from the Boot.dev course:
Build an AI Agent in Python:
https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-ai-agent-python

This Course cover how to build an LLM-powered command-line program capable of reading, updating, and running Python code using the Gemini API. Learn how LLMs and agentic coding tools work. Write a toy agentic code editor in Python, similar to Claude Code or Cursor's agent mode. Understand how agents work from scratch by using the free Google Gemini API to create an LLM-powered code agent. You'll use function calling and feedback loops to build an agent that can find and fix bugs in a real project! 

Course Overview

1. LLMs
- Learn how LLMs work and send prompts to the Gemini API using the Python client library
2. Functions
- Write the functions your AI agent will need to modify files and run Python code
3. Function Calling
- Give your AI agent the ability to call functions based on its system prompt and context window
4. Agents
- Give your tool a proper feedback loop to make it truly "agentic" and fix a real bug
